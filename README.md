# Getting started
For the hackathon, your environment to build your prototype on is brought to you by IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud - anyone can sign up and have an access to the Linux on Z virtual server. You can find more details here: https://developer.ibm.com/linuxone/

To get setup for the weekend, complete the following steps:



1. Follow the steps in the link to request for LinuxONE server. Request SLES for your operating system.

2. Once your Linux guest is running and you can ssh into the guest, copy the installation script onto your guest.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SweetJenn23/MaristBlockchainHackathon/master/ZFabricBuild-1.4.sh -o ZFabricBuild-1.4.sh
```

3. Issue the following command to make the script executable. `chmod u+x ZFabricBuild-1.4.sh`
4. Run the script to build your blockchain environment. `./ZFabricBuild-1.4.sh`



Once the proceeding steps have been successfully completed, please continue on to Lab1.
